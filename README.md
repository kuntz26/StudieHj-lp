# StudieHj√¶lp

This is a website made with python and flask as the backend. This can help students with their budget, and with homework.

The budget helper has three things. The first thing is where you can insert some data about your income and expences and it will calculate the space in your budget and it will make a graph using plotly.

The help for homework is split in two parts. A forum where people can post a question on some problem and they can get comments. The other part is private messages, where you find someone via the forum. 

These are the overall features of the application. There are some other small features that make the website seem more put together. 

The flask application is in the app.py file. The bank_transactions.py contains code for reading a csv file, which is a feature for the budget helper. The helper.py contains extra code that is reused a few times.
